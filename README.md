# Dice Game

This is a two player game where the users playing have to roll the dice, if the dice lands on 1 it automatically switches to the other player if it lands on a number other than 1 then the current score continues to add up as the user keeps rolling the dice. The user can decide to hold the score if they don't want to risk losing all the points they have saved up by landing on a 1, once the hold button is clicked it switches over to the other player. Whoever reaches the score of 50+ wins the game!
